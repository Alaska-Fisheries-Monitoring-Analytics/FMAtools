<!-- badges: end -->

A collection of utility functions for use by the NOAA Fisheries AFSC FMA
Analyst Team.

## Installation

Install or update your package by running:
``` r
devtools::install_github("Alaska-Fisheries-Monitoring-Analytics/FMAtools")
```
If you have not yet, you'll need to set up a githubPAT. [Set up a classic GitHub token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with a 90-day expiration (or regenerate an exisiting one), copy the token to your clipboard, and then add it locally in R by running:
``` r
gitcreds::gitcreds_set()
```

## `gdrive_` functions

If you intend to use the `gdrive_` functions of this package, you must
first authorize the `googledrive::` package to access your NOAA
accountâ€™s Google Drive. Run the following line to open a browser window
to do this, which must be done only once. **Make sure to check the box granting the package access to your files!** You will otherwise get 403 errors for insufficient permissions!

``` r
# Authorize the googledrive:: package to access your NOAA Google Drive
googledrive::drive_auth()
```

## Querying databases using `db_query()`

Use the `db_query()` function as a shortcut to both perform a query and connect to a database. The `dsn` arugment of the function, which is `channel_afsc` by default, is used to reference your local `.Renviron` file where you can store your database connection method. Other `dsn` you may want to assign are `channel_cas` and `channel_akfin`. Please use these aliases to be consistent with the rest of the team.

You can edit your `.Renviron` file using:

``` r
`usethis::edit_r_environ()
```
ensuring that your `dsn` is defined with your desired database connection method. For example, your .Renviron script may look like:
``` r
AFSCid = <USERNAME>
AFSCpw = <PASSWORD>
channel_afsc = "library(odbc); dbConnect(drv = odbc::odbc(), dsn = 'AFSC', UID = Sys.getenv('AFSCid'), PWD = Sys.getenv('AFSCpw'))"
```
You can test your connection with a simple query. 
``` r
FMAtools::db_query(paste0("select sysdate from dual"), dsn = "channel_afsc")
```
