## Installation

You might need to set up a githubPAT:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Alaska-Fisheries-Monitoring-Analytics/FMAtools")
```

## `gdrive_` functions

If you intend to use the `gdrive_` functions of this package, you must
first authorize the `googledrive::` package to access your NOAA
accountâ€™s Google Drive. Run the following line to open a browser window
to do this, which must be done only once. **Make sure to check the box granting the package access to your files!** You will otherwise get 403 errors for insufficient permissions!

``` r
# Authorize the googledrive:: package to access your NOAA Google Drive
googledrive::drive_auth()
```
