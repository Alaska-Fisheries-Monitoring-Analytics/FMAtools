<!-- badges: end -->

A collection of utility functions for use by the NOAA Fisheries AFSC FMA
Analyst Team.

## Installation

You might need to set up a githubPAT:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Alaska-Fisheries-Monitoring-Analytics/FMAtools")
```

## `gdrive_` functions

If you intend to use the `gdrive_` functions of this package, you must
first authorize the `googledrive::` package to access your NOAA
accountâ€™s Google Drive. Run the following line to open a browser window
to do this, which must be done only once. **Make sure to check the box granting the package access to your files!** You will otherwise get 403 errors for insufficient permissions!

``` r
# Authorize the googledrive:: package to access your NOAA Google Drive
googledrive::drive_auth()
```

## Querying databases using `db_query()`

Use the `db_query()` function as a shortcut to both perform a query and connect to a database. The `dsn` arugment of the function, which is `channel_afsc` by default, is used to reference your local `.Renviron` file where you can store your database connection method. You can edit your `.Renviron` file using `usethis::edit_r_environ()`, ensuring that your `dsn` is defined with your desired database connection method.
