# WHERE JJ LEFT OFF:

# TODOS

  1. See if you can get them working.  Located in \code {notes/.github}

2023-03-13: fix `load_rdat()`

2023-03-08: All github actions were non-functional and therefore moved to \code{notes/.github} where they are safely ignored by R CMD checks.  Added to TODO list - Perhaps someday get them working.

2023-03-08: fix \code{read.csv} ==> \code{utils::read.csv} and \code{write.csv} ==> \code{utils::write.csv}

2023-03-08: created \code{is_date_fmt()} based on function found here:
https://gist.github.com/micstr/69a64fbd0f5635094a53?permalink_comment_id=3432683#gistcomment-3432683
