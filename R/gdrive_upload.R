#' Upload a File to the Google Shared Drive
#'
#' `gdrive_upload()` is used to either upload a new file to the specified Gdrive folder, or, if the file already exists,
#' updates the file by creating a new version. In the background, it assigns the modified dates of the local file to the
#' gdrive file/version, ensures older versions are kept forever, and checks to see whether uploading a new version is
#' necessary. Currently only works with `.rdata` and `.rds` type files. Nearly all other files we use should be
#' maintained the project's GitHub repository.
#'
#' @param local_path the file path to the local file that you wish to upload or update.
#' @param gdrive_dribble the `dribble` object of the Gdrive folder you wish to upload to, created by `gdrive_set_dribble`.
#' @export
#'
#' @return Returns messages regarding whether the upload was completed, and if so, the version number.
