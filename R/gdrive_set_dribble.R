#' Designate a Gdrive Folder as a Target for Uploads and Downloads
#'
#' Given a folder path of the folder structure of the Shared Google Drive, this function will create a `dribble`
#' class object for use by key functions to interact with the drive, including `gdrive_upload()` and
#' `gdrive_download()`. By default, it searches the FMA Analytical Services Program shared drive.
#'
#' @param gdrive_path a character string of the folder path, with each folder name followed by `/`
#' @param folder_id a character string of the folder's ID, which must be used instead of \code{gdrive_path} for
#' collaborators with only shared access to a shared drive's subfolder and not root access to the shared drive.
#' @param shared_id a character string of the shared drive's ID or an alias for the Shared Drive to connect to. The
#' default alias, `Analytics`, is so far the only alias that is currently recognized.
#'
#' @details If you do not know the folder path to the folder you want to interact with, run `gdrive_dir()` to get
#' the view the folder structure of the Share Google Drive and copy-paste the `path`
#'
#' @return Returns a dribble class object
