\description{
Prints the structure of the Shared Google Drive to the console. It provides a count of the files within
each folder and all subfolders. Items in the 'path' column can be copy-pasted to use as the
\code{gdrive_path} argument of the \code{gdrive_set_dribble(gdrive_path)} function. Highly recommended to use the \code{folder}
argument as it will speed up your search.
}
\details{
Use this function to retrieve the file paths of every folder in the Shared Google Drive.
Once you have found the folder you would like to upload to or download from, copy its \code{path} to use
as the \code{gdrive_path} argument of the \code{gdrive_set_dribble()} function.
