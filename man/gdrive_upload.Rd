\description{
\code{gdrive_upload()} is used to either upload a new file to the specified Gdrive folder, or, if the file already exists,
updates the file by creating a new version. In the background, it assigns the modified dates of the local file to the
gdrive file/version, ensures older versions are kept forever, and checks to see whether uploading a new version is
necessary. Currently only works with \code{.rdata} and \code{.rds} type files. Nearly all other files we use should be
maintained the project's GitHub repository.
